# PFRPG Loaded Indicator
This extension aids in tracking whether ranged weapons are loaded. To do this, it adds a checkbox to the left of the ammo label on the weapons section of the actions tab.
This checkbox is only shown for some weapons (those with 'firearm', 'crossbow', 'javelin', 'ballista', 'windlass', 'pistol', 'rifle', or 'loadaction' in the weapon name).
Loading the weapon will post a message to chat to help monitor the action-economy.
Attacks made with these weapons without loading first will post a message to chat.
Attacking will mark-off ammunition automatically.
Attacking will post to chat if there is no ammunition available or if the final arrow is used.
